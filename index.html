                Earth has been attacked by a horde of aliens!<br />
                You are the captain of the USS Assembly, on a mission<br />to destroy
                every last alien ship.<br />

                Battle the aliens as you try to destroy them with your lasers.<br />

                There are six alien ships. The aliens' weakness is that they are
                <br />
                logical and attack one at a time: they will wait to see the outcome
                of<br />
                a battle before deploying another alien ship. Your strength is
                <br />that you have the initiative and get to attack first. However,
                you<br />
                do not have targeting lasers and can only attack the aliens<br />
                in order. After you have destroyed a ship, you have the <br />option
                to make a hasty retreat.<br />
