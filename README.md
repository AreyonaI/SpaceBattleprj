**SPACE BATTLE**

This is a simple web based game made as a project during my SWE bootcamp with Per Scholas and took me about a week to finish. 
Simple game where players take command of the USS Assembly and engage in intense battles against alien invaders. It uses HTML, Javascript, and CSS emphasis on the Javascript part. 
Has some redundant code but its main purpose was to further my expertise in web development and the used programmming languges so it's alright for now. 
I do plan to continue working on this project to make it feel more like a full game by adding levels, weapons, characters, a story, etc...
